In the Bible, God led the Israelites by way of the wilderness toward the Red Sea. Then, he guided the people around in a large circle. As the people camped at the edge of the Red Sea, they noticed that the mountains were on one side, and the sea was on the other side of them.
 When the Israelites saw Pharaoh’s soldiers in the distance charging toward them, it appeared as though they were trapped with no apparent way out. Terrified, the people cried out to Moses in despair. There seemed to be no hope for them at all. But, Moses trusted God during this impossible time. Moses didn’t get upset, give up or give in to desperation. Rather, Moses steered the people’s attention to God and calmly gave a solution as he said:
“Do not be afraid. Stand firm. And you will see the deliverance of the Lord. The Lord will fight for you while you keep silent.” (Exodus 14:13-14)God will be pleased.God will be reliesed and concious.You get divine defence,God  will be your guider and your defender.You will recieve light and not be confused.God will fight your battles and give you victory over your enemies.God will Provide for you in the time of your needs,Jeremiah 29vs11 For i know the good plans that i have for you,to prosper you and not to harm you!
